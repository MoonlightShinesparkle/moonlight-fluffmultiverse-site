            So it looks like you found this page, most likely through curiosity of belle's
            watch button, well currently belle is in maintenance mode, but what is it?
        </div>
        <div class="Separation"></div>
        <p class="Title">
            What is maintenance mode?
        </p>
        <div class="Contents">
            It's nothing more than belle learning how to do something new, or learning how
            to do something he knew but better, currently belle's code is running on moon's
            computer and will be uploaded once the code is fully made
        </div>
        <div class="Separation"></div>
        <p class="Title">
            Be careful, am learning ;w;
        </p>
        <div class="Contents">
            Belle's new commands or current commands may end up in erratic or unfinished
            results, make sure to know the commands avaiable on the maintenance version of
            Belle may differ from the released version

            Commands
        </p>
        <div class="Contents">
            Belle's commands may be the same after maintenance mode ends, sometimes there
            may be more commands, other times the whole system will be changed, checking belle's
            version is adviced if you want to know if the changes are applied or not

            Fun facts

        <div class="Contents">
            - The belle bot came before the moon AU, it wasn't after some time that belle
            would actually become part of the moon AUs and even adquire a sister<br>
            <hr>
            - An updated version of belle was under planning and was going to be Sakura
            Buttermilk herself, but it was decided for belle to be updated instead<br>
            <hr>
            - Moonbelle was originally "Moonclone" and was going to be in another server
            to respond to messages on moon's den server, but the idea was scrapped due to
            there not being a way to keep the bot running constantly (the point was for
            the bot to respond on moon being unavaiable) which would also include some of the
            global slash commands found (like the modulus command)<br>
            <hr>
            - Moonbelle was originally made to log user votes (people voting people) and resetting
            them on need, this feature was unused and will be removed [if it hasn't already]<br>
            <hr>
            - Moonbelle doesn't/didn't have any capacity to be used in other servers [due to not having a
            form of free data storage], this will be changed in further belle versions [if it wasn't changed already]<br>
            <hr>
            - This page makes use of " " which is the character U+00a0 "non-breaking space", why? well
            so the title doesn't stick together, html ignored my little normal space -w-"

            }
