            Welcome to my webpage, here you may find different misc which are my
            creations, due to the nature of them, they will be left in different sections.
            The page was once a place solely for my drawings, but then I added one for some
            WIP misc for a bot, one day I was given the school project of making a webpage from
            scratch, this left me able to rework on my HTML skills and left me with a toolset capable
            of leaving me able to create a better webpage, one that is more ordered and has a nice
            structure for my needs.
        </p>
        <h2>
            My projects
