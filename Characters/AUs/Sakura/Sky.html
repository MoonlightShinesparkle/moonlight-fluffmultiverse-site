                Sakura [usually known as Sky] is a wolf who has
                the objective of being able to understand the 
                <a href="/Spark.html">spark</a> and explore
                the multiverse.

                <hr>
                Sakura decided to make a research facility in order to be able to create
                more powerful technology, one of them being battery sized fusion reactors.
                One day she found a way to teleport herself to other places: the amorphous
                crystaline energetic matter translocator (Or rift for short) which left her
                upgrade the facility to research teleportation and other universes. One day
                she tried making a rift but decided to change the recipe of it, it ended up
                creating a rift capable of teleporing you to different universes on their
                universe. After some time she found out how to make rifts enter another
                multiverse and gave <a href="/Characters/AUs/Moonlight/Moonstar.html">Moonstar</a>
                the modified rift so they could keep on exploring and finding stuff that may
                benefit them.

                <div class="Title">The facility</div>
                The facility itself can be considered multiple buildings of different kinds and
                purposes, all interconnected via rifts. Many of these buildings have their air
                filtered to avoid heavy metals as people who can't withstand them come to be 
                researched in some cases, also to increase air quality in different operations.<br>
                The facility has multiple factory facilities, a metallurgy site and a storage site,
                on the research facility there's multiple experimenting rooms on the which people
                go through different studies to be researched, a set of offices, a set of labs,
                a break room and a kitchen. The facility's storage also has a docking bay for 
                prime resources to come to be used by the facility.<br>
                Some empty rooms may be found, these are used to develop and create different tools,
                but in some cases they are developed in the place they're needed. The facilty manages 
                resources via crates, these contain different parts that may be needed or that are 
                going to be sold.
