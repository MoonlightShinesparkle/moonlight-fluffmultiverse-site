                Moonstar [usually known as Star] is a 
                felis vulpes [cat-fox] which has the capacity to
                freeze stuff with his paws, he helps 
                <a>Sakura</a>
                on her objective of being able to understand the 
                <a href="/Spark.html">spark</a> and explore
                the multiverse

                Moonstar has a rosequartz rift which leaves him teleport through
                the multiverse he lives at, he tries to compile information on the
                <a href="/Spark.html">spark</a>'s
                effects, but he also enjoys seeing his AUs and sometimes helping them,
                he isn't usually seen when researching unless he reaches the moons 
                himself. An intereting thing about the crystal is how it can show the 
                AUs you have by holding it

                <div class="Title">Lore</div>
                Moonstar has traveled through the multiverse using his rift, gathering
                information that could be useful for misc stuff such as understanding
                the rift or stuff that could lead to inventions or inventions themselves
                that could help them or their universe.<br>
                One time he decided to teleport to another multiverse: something that 
                wasn't done before by them. Sakura trusted Star with this mission as it
                would be able to lead to more research explorations, so he decided to start
                his mission. Star prepared himself with his tools and decided to travel
                to the other multiverse.<br>
                Star appeared on the same multiverse
                <a href="/Characters/Moon.html">Moonlight</a> teleported to by accident
                with his collar and found a lost bow: one that looked like the one Sakura
                made to him. He then decided to investigate the scene as it seemed he wasn't 
                the first moon to travel to another multiverse. Moonstar decided to look 
                at the nearby cafe and found Moonlight talking to Basten, he decided to
                listen nearby without them noticing and with the stuff he could hear he
                concluded that Moonlight got lost due to an issue with his collar, it was
                then that he wondered how his collar worked, if he had other stuff like that,
                after that he decided that he would like to find that moon in the future when 
                he comes back home.
