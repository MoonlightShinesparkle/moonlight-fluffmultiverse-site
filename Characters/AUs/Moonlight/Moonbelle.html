                Moonbelle [usually known as belle] is a 
                felis vulpes [cat-fox] which has the capacity to
                generate fire with his paws, he was adopted by
                Sakura's parents and has learned to bake thanks
                to them.<br>

                Belle and Sakura consider each other sisters, Belle being the little one by a year. Sakura
                jokingly insists on calling Belle her sister, which he takes well. Both like to be together
                and love spending time together, sometimes sharing eachother recipes they think about and
                other times bake along with their parents and learn a new recipe or make one of their recipes
                better (and also enjoying the result of hard work)
