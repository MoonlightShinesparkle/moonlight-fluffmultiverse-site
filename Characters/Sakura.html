                Sakura is a wolf who is <a href="/Characters/Moon.html">Moonlight</a>'s best friend
                she has known moon since she was a pup, they both have been helping each
                other; She is very good at arts and crafts

                <div class="Title">Lore</div>
                As sakura is moon's best friend, she tends to visit
                Moonlight and <a href="/Characters/Shadow.html">Moonshadow</a> or they
                visit her, this has been for a while. One day Moon teleported
                away by accident and shadow decided to tell her about it
                <img src="/images/lore/shadow/Home1.png"/>
                <img src="/images/lore/shadow/Home2.png"/>
                <img src="/images/lore/shadow/Home3.png"/>
                Since that day, she has been going to moon's home to try to
                see when he'll be back, 2 weeks later she finally could
                find moon

                <img src="/images/lore/moon/sakura2.png"/>
                <img src="/images/lore/moon/sakura3.png"/>
                After that they both talked, sakura ended up walking
                home while moon decided to fix his collar
