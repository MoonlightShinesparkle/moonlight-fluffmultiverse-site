                Moonshadow's lore starts some time ago, when moon felt quite bad 
                due to a school work he had to do, it was at that momment that shadow 
                could emerge from moon and be able to be physically separate from him, 
                yet still linked to him due to his species' nature.<br>
                [notice: it has shadow's old design, use the refsheet on the start for his most current design]

                <img src="/images/lore/moon/shadow3.png"/>
                After some time, moon told Sakura about shadow and they both met, after that day they both
                became friends too.<br>
                After a while, Moon decided to test his teleport collar, which ended up in him teleporting to 
                another multiverse, he decided to tell Sakura about this and they both agreed that he should stay
                in her house and that sakura would check moon's house periodically to see if he's back
