			- The belle bot came before the moon AU, it wasn't after some time that belle
			would actually become part of the moon AUs and even adquire a sister<br>
			<hr>
			- An updated version of belle was under planning and was going to be Sakura
			Buttermilk herself, but it was decided for belle to be updated instead<br>
			<hr>
			- Moonbelle was originally "Moonclone" and was going to be in another server
			to respond to messages on moon's den server, but the idea was scrapped due to
			there not being a way to keep the bot running constantly (the point was for
			the bot to respond on moon being unavaiable) which would also include some of the
			global slash commands found (like the modulus command)<br>
			<hr>
			- Moonbelle was originally made to log user votes (people voting people) and resetting
			them on need, this feature was unused and will be removed [if it hasn't already]<br>
			<hr>
			- Moonbelle doesn't/didn't have any capacity to be used in other servers [due to not having a
			form of free data storage], this will be changed in further belle versions [if it wasn't changed already]
