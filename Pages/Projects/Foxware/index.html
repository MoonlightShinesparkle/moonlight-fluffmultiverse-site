			Welcome to a chunk of my school project!
		</h2>
		<div class="Division">
			<img src="/Images/GUI/Foxware/BackgroundFox.png" alt="Fox icon"/>
			<p>
				Imagine this: last year you could see how a grade was working on webpages
				and how they weren't doing the best… you think you'd do well though; you're tasked with
				making SVG images and drafts on all the miscellaneous of a company made by you from scratch,
				now it's the next year and with the stuff you did now you have to make a website from scratch,
				luckily you already made a webpage so you have the idea of how to make one, good thing you do
				as apparently the school book itself is teaching a deprecated way of making webpages that most
				likely is no longer supported (or won't be supported) by browsers… that was my situation!
			</p>
			<p>
				While the others were working with the "Font" tag, i was working with CSS scripts and the
				teacher told me to focus entirely in making this webpage instead of the textbook assignments, this
				gave me the chance to work on my abilities of making webpages
			</p>
			<img src="/Images/GUI/Foxware/Script.png" alt="Script with background" class="right">
			<p>
				Miscellaneous things could improve from my old way of making webpages, this includes the design overall,
				making boxes look better by rounding them, make images fit better, apply scripts better, increment my
				knowledge on CSS, etc. All of this without the textbook… how ironic, usually one would think the textbook
				is what teaches this, nopies! it doesn't at all, a good chunk of what i've done here isn't in the textbook,
				to the point i was constantly helping my classmates in the task of debugging or creating a system or feature,
				my page was the only one which could scale to a certain degree though
			</p>
			<p>
				The images of the fox being made in SVG made me not able to draw a fox as i usually would, making the design
				not be to my best of standards. Making a company didn't imply only making a webpage, but also making merchandise
				and different kinds of papers, so why not share with you the design i made for a cup? it's lovely for any coffee lover
				out there, just print it as it is in a cup and enjoy!
			</p>

			<p>
				It's a transparent PNG if you're wondering, the image was drawn by me through ibis paint like how i usually would, which shows
				how i'm much better at making PNGs rather than SVGs

		<h2>
			The name
		</h2>
		<div class="Division">
			<p>
				The name comes as a joke between the word "Fox" (at this point it's not a mistery i'm a furry… and i thought a fox would be
				a cute idea for the base of a company) and "Software" (as the company's product would be making software and helping on the
				making of different kinds of software), ending up with "Foxware", and of course i just decided to add "Incorporated" in the
				fashion of Doofenshmirtz evil incorporated… and some other companies of course, but i just keep on reminding myself on that
				by the word "incorporated"
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2>
			My improvements
		</h2>
		<div class="Division">
			<p>
				My improvements mostly come on the design of pages and its internal layout, making me able to have a cleaner layout for my
				workings, also a page which looks better than what i could do before while keeping it scalable for my purposes, but here's a list
				of my improvements:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Usage of borders in blocks for design
				</li>
				<li>
					CSS knowledge
				</li>
