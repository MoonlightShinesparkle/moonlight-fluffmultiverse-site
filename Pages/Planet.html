			<img src="/images/others/planet/Main.png"/>
			Neutrum is a liveable solid supergiant planet which developed on top of a
			neutron star, it is composed of 9 different layers which
			may be split on different layers based on convenience.
			<div class="Title">Dangers</div>
			Neutrum's layers contain high concentrations of heavy
			and super heavy metals, some materials that would instantly
			fission into more stable materials don't do so in this planet
			due to the presence of specialized particles that stabilize
			the atom. The population of the planet is inmune to these
			metals, so many of them are considered safe when they could
			cause problems to live beings that weren't born in the planet.
			<div class="Title">Unique weather</div>
			In this planet you can find unique weather on the atmosphere layer.
			Usually clouds form on the top parts of the neutrosphere, but they
			can also form high enough to be over the atmosphere or form between
			these 2 layers. Some cities can be found in between the atmosphere and
			neutrosphere, this causes clouds to engulf the city and in some cases 
			cause a point zero thunderstorm, on the which lightning bolts form on the 
			cloud and quickly hit the city ot what they find in their path, luckily
			these are less powerful than the regular lightning bolts and won't cause 
			lots of damage if it hits peopleâ€¦ besides messy fluff
			<div class="Title">Particle system</div>
			<img src="/images/others/planet/particles.png"/>
			The standard particle system in Neutrum is the standard
			neutrian supersymmetric system which includes axions
			along with its fermionic counterpart; It also
			includes a new spin 3 particle: the stabilion, it is
			a particle which serves as a kind of glue for the atom's core,
			helping neutrons and protons stay together in huge quantities
			<div class="Title">Layers</div>
			Planet neutrum is composed of 9 differen layers
			<img src="/images/others/planet/Layers.png"/>
			<div class="Subtitle">Core</div>
			The core is a neutron star that can carry atoms on its surface,
			this left atoms accumulate in it on early planet stages.
			<div class="Subtitle">Neutrocorium</div>
			The matter that decided to stay on top of the star got all of
			their nuclei fused together into a single nucleus, turning
			it into a single atom, this happened until the forces of the
			atom couldn't allow more matter to form part of its composition.
			<div class="Subtitle">Nullayer</div>
			Due to the neutrocorium's forces, matter is not allowed to be
			close at the neutrocorium, this left an area with absence of
			matter, this absence of matter was named "Nullayer" and the 
			most you can find in there is parts of the magton slightly
			fluctuating into it just to end up pushed back to the magton
			<div class="Subtitle">Magton</div>
			Composed of melted super heavy elemnts, this layer is completely
			made out of magma, it is composed by some of the heaviest elements
			on the planet, it is theorized that some elements haven't been discovered
			still that may compose this layer
			<div class="Subtitle">Mantle</div>
			The mantle is composed of different kinds of materials based on the 
			depth and location at the which you are, it holds some caves which 
			can be rich in different kinds of strong crystals or be full of magton
			contents, it is theorized that reaching one of these caves full of
			magton material could lead to the discovery of new elements
			<div class="Subtitle">Crust</div>
			The crust holds the most common elements on the planet, it holds the 
			elements required for life, while lower layers also show presence of
			these elements, their concentraction goes under minimun on the lower
			parts of the mantle. Some parts of it can be missing in certan areas,
			leaving space for exploration on the mantle.
			<div class="Subtitle">Neutrosphere</div>
			The neutrosphere is a layer composed of air, it is the same air that 
			can be found on the other air composed layers, the difference is that 
			in this layer, certain ammounts of matter can float in it but never over
			it. The reason matter can float in it is due to some forces the neutron 
			star uses on the matter that floats in it, matter can still float due
			to other reasons such as differences in density.
			Due to the behaviour of the neutrosphere, the planet's surface is 
			composed by floating islands
			<div class="Subtitle">Atmosphere</div>
			A layer composed of air, unlike the neutrosphere, matter can't float in it
			due to the neutron star's forces and its color differs.
			<div class="Subtitle">Orbitosphere</div>
			The furthest layer of the planet is also composed of air, albeit in small 
			quantities. Certain satelites orbit the planet close enough to the point
			they can interact with the orbitosphere, this causes the satelite to
			slowly gather matter from the orbitosphere, giving the satelite an atmosphere
			similar to neutrum's
