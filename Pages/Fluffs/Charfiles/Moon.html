				<div class="Title">Lore</div>
				Moon's lore starts a long time ago: after he got hit by
				spark, he found out he was capable of doing stuff such
				as charging his phone by just holding it.<br>
				After a while, he ended up getting his paws on a special
				pair of gloves and glasses, these capable of taking code in
				the WCLANG language and embedding it into objects, then leaving
				it run causing the object to behave based on the code, moon
				took this oportunity to create stuff to fix his day to day
				issues or just to have something conventient. One of his creations
				was a coffee cup capable of flying to his paw
				<img src="/images/Mooncoffee.png"/>
				Another one of his creations is a rod which acts as an umbrella, this
				was done as 
				<a href="/Planet.html">planet neutrum</a>'s condition
				are too extreme to the point they can lift up moon from the ground
				if he holds an umbrella

				After some time, moon had the missfortune of getting assigned a
				school project, due to him being very tired, he could leave
				<a href="/Characters/Shadow.html">Moonshadow</a> materialize<br>
				<span class="BiggerText">Notice:</span> these drawings include shadow's old design, make sure to
				check his character page for his redesign

				One day moon decided to create a collar to leave him teleport to his 
				favorite cafe or whoever he wanted to go, sadly it ended up failing 
				and ended up teleporting moon to another multiverse. There he met a 
				cat whose name is Basten, this cat decided to help him go back to 
				his homeworld

				Due to a small mistake, the portal ended up failng and instead 
				teleporting both to another multiverse, this one being a library 
				where people fighted each other so they could get a book in specific.
				After both came through, they were quickly attacked as the librarians 
				throught that they were attackers, but they were shielded by the 
				one of the sephirah of the library, the library entered lockdown and 
				both of them ended up living in the library for some time.<br>
				Moon caused a bread shortage in the place after he figured out how 
				space-time continuum works in the library, he found this through 
				a little experiment he did
				<img src="/images/lore/moon/main10.png"/>
				<img src="/images/lore/moon/main11.png"/>
				But after some time, Basten decided to go back to his homweorld, due to
				this, a sephirah wanted to go there to find out more about the place and 
				be able to go there in some cases, so (0,0) opened a portal that left 
				all of them go to his computer and exit to his home if needed. Moon stayed
				on the computer and decided to do stuff such as play some games, compress 
				bread and other misc.<br>

				Sadly another invasion happened in the library, so everyone had to go
				back to it. While basten and the sephirah were battling, moon was scourted 
				back to the entrance so moon could be safe from the invasion. After some time, 
				the area had to be evacuated, but while moon was running to a safe place, moon 
				ended up getting teleported back home thanks to his bestie: 
				<a href="/Characters/Sakura.html">Sakura</a>

				<img src="/images/lore/moon/sakura3.png"/>
				After coming back home, moon decided to try to fix his collar again,
				sadly it didn't work againâ€¦ luckily he had this in mind, so he added
				a safeguard that would teleport him back in some minutes
				<img src="/images/lore/moon/main13.png"/>
				that ended up teleporting him to another place
