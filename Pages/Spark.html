			The spark is a special lightning bolt which strucks
			the planet <a href="/Planet.html">Neutrum</a> every
			month
			<video src="/videos/spark.mov" preload="auto" controls></video>
			<div class="Title">Effects</div>
			When someone gets hit by the lightning bolt, part of
			the energy is kept on the person, due to it the person
			is capable of controlling a specific kind of energy.<br>
			The energy the person controls seems to be random; the 
			name of the process on the which the person gets struck 
			is called <span class="Tarnation">"luminance"</span>
			<div style="height: 10px"></div>
			<div class="Title" id="Luminances">Luminances</div>
			While the process itself is called <span class="Tarnation">luminance</span>,
			someone being capable of controlling a certain kind of energy is considered
			<span class="Tarnation2">prefix</span><span class="Tarnation">luminance</span>,
			where <span class="Tarnation2">prefix</span> is the kind of energy you can 
			control.<br>
			The ammount of energy the person controls varies on the ammount of energy
			that stayed on the person and the practice the person has put into it,
			other variables such as illnesses and how much the person has eaten and 
			slept also impact on it.
			<div class="Subtitle" id="Electroluminance">Electroluminance</div>
			<img class="Luximg" src="/images/others/luminance/Electro.png"/>
			Electroluminance gives people the capacity to store, generate
			and transfer electrons, this luminance tends to make their
			biology completely depend on electrons as a source of energy.<br>
			Electroluminiscent people can technically also generate heat
			through this, but due to them not being able to tolerate such
			heat they avoid this.<br>
			Electroluminance's weakness is thermal energy, avoiding them
			from doing some actions that pyroluminance can do.
			<div class="Subtitle" id="Pyroluminance">Pyroluminance</div>
			<img class="Luximg" src="/images/others/luminance/Pyro.png"/>
			Pyroluminance gives people the capacity to control the increment
			of thermal energy and capacity of starting combustion on certain
			objects or generate a flame. Pyroluminance tends on making people
			capable of resisting huge ammounts of heat.<br>
			While they can resist huge ammounts of heat, they have a limit on
			how much they can handle. Their weakness is cold.
			<div class="Subtitle" id="Cryoluminance">Cryoluminance</div>
			<img class="Luximg" src="/images/others/luminance/Cryo.png"/>
			Cryoluminance gives people the capacity to control the decrement
			of thermal energy and capacity to withstand these temperature.<br>
			Cryoluminance tends on making people unable to be frozen at a certain
			extent and makes them incapable of suffering hipothermia at a certain
			extent.<br>
			While they can resist huge lack of heat, they have a limit on how
			much they can freeze something. Their weakness is heat.
			<div class="Subtitle" id="Photoluminance">Photoluminance</div>
			<img class="Luximg" src="/images/others/luminance/Photo.png"/>
			Photoluminance gives people the capacity of controlling electromagnetic
			radiation by generating, redirecting or absorbing it.<br>
			Photoluminance tends on making people resistant to ionizing radiation.<br>
			While they can control photons, they usually can't generate higly energetic photons
			for a long time. Their weakness is electricity as they tend to be more conductive
			and less resistant to heat.
			<div class ="Subtitle" id="Kineluminance">Kineluminance</div>
			<img class="Luximg" src="/images/others/luminance/Kine.png"/>
			Kineluminance gives people the capacity of controlling kinetic energy
			by giving it or removing it to objects, they can also change the 
			direction of it as this force tends to be in vectors.<br>
			While they can manipulate this energy, they have a huge difficulty
			on manipulating it on smaller particles, making them unable to 
			change the kinetic energy of viruses and hardly be able to move
			bacteria.<br>
			The ammount of energy they can manipulate varies on the size, mass
			and volume of the object or the quantity of energy if it is redirected
			or removed.
			<div class="Title">Integration with biology</div>
			The process of luminance tends of integrating the absorved energy
			to the person's biology, it can be partial or total and also seems
			completely random.
			<div class="Subtitle">Partial</div>
			The most common integration is partial, where the body doens't 
			depends on the energy accumulated and barely benefits from the 
			presence of it.<br>
			Partial integration leaves the person capable of using this energy
			as much as they want, sometimes to the point of it running out but 
			leaving little to no consequences, the most affecting possible consequence 
			is a feeling of slight tiredness or hunger.
			<div class="Subtitle">Total</div>
			Total integration leaves the person dependant of the energy, making
			the person capable of using a bigger ammount of this on more circumtances
			and giving them different properties, but leave higher consequences 
			when the person starts running out of energy.<br>
			Someone dependant on the energy requires it to be awake and be capable
			of doing day to day actions, this makes their blood completely be replaced
			by a flow of energy with the capacity of carrying compounds, a great ability
			to recover from massive damage but with the downside of passing out after
			recieving such ammounds of damage or losing a lot of energy, being
			capable of stopping being passed out by recharging this energy, but this is 
			mostly limited to pyroluminance, electroluminance and Photoluminance.<br>
			This happens as the cells of the person depend on the energy as their source 
			of energy. Total integration leaves the person turn food directly into energy,
			it also makes an environment where microorganisms can't trive.<br>
			Electroluminiscent and Pyroluminiscent people are more probable of having
			total integration, this integration type leaves them use more energy than 
			partial integration but have to be more careful about how they use the energy.<br>
			Totally dependent people can condense their body into a ball of electricity when
			there's huge damage on the person as a defense mechanism, they cannot
			control themselves in this form and are mostly inert, they tend to stay in this 
			shape for hours until they're recovered from it.
